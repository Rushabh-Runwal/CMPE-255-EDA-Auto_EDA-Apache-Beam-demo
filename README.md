Welcome to my Data Science repository! This project includes three key tasks, each demonstrating different aspects of data analysis and real-time processing. The project is divided into the following sections:

---

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Spotify Dataset ðŸŽµ

In this task, I performed manual **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using the Spotify dataset. The analysis includes:
- Understanding the dataset structure.
- Uncovering insights related to tracks, artists, and genres.
- Generating visualizations to highlight patterns in the data.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
  
**Files**:
- `spotify_eda.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the entire EDA process for the Spotify dataset.

## 2. Auto EDA with Sweetviz for Amazon Prime Users Dataset ðŸ›’

In this task, I used **Sweetviz**, an automated EDA tool, to quickly generate a detailed report on the **Amazon Prime Users** dataset. Sweetviz is incredibly useful for generating insights and visual reports without manual coding.

**Steps**:
- Load the Amazon Prime Users dataset.
- Run **Sweetviz** to generate a full report.
- Interpret the automatically generated visualizations.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Python**: Sweetviz for automatic data analysis.
  
**Files**:
- `amazon_prime_auto_eda.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Auto EDA code using Sweetviz.
- `amazon_prime_sweetviz_report.html`: HTML report generated by Sweetviz, viewable directly in your browser.

## 3. Apache Beam Demo for Real-time Transaction Processing ðŸ’»

In this task, I demonstrated the use of **Apache Beam** to process streaming e-commerce transactions in real time. This includes:
- Simulating a stream of transactions with fields like `product`, `quantity`, and `price`.
- Applying transformations to calculate total cost and discounted prices.
- Classifying transactions as **high-value**, **medium-value**, or **low-value** based on the total cost.
  
**Technologies Used**:
- **Apache Beam**: For real-time data processing and transformations.
  
**Files**:
- `apache_beam_demo.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook showcasing the complete Apache Beam pipeline for real-time transaction processing.
